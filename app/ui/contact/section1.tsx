              personalizing and optimizing our platform, processing payment
              transactions, offering customer support, analyzing and improving
              data, and conducting consumer surveys. During the provision of
              these services, these Service Providers may have access to your

              equipped with standard SSL certification, ensuring a secure
              connection between our server and users for any data transmission
              or interaction. Protective measures include firewalls, data
              encryption, physical access controls at our data centers, and
              authorization controls for information access. User passwords are
              encrypted using 64-bit encryption and securely stored, considering
              that users often reuse passwords across multiple platforms,
              mitigating the potential for theft, piracy, or unauthorized
              access. Should you suspect any compromise of your Courses for
